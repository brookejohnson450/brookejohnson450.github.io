title: Reflective Post 3 - Analyzing A Blog
---

This week, I decided to analyze one of my favorite blogs. Again. I won't apologize for this.

Anyway, this week I am looking at [Mrs. Dow Jones' Blog](https://mrsdowjones.com/) by Haley Sacks. She is an established blogger and personal finance meme queen on social media, so obviously I love her and everything she stands for. I am not here to obsess over someone trying to break the glass ceiling by becoming the Kim K in finance! I am here to look at her blog!

This blog is related back to the weekly hands-on activity due to many aspects. One of those being that the blog has a navigation bar! While it does not have a specific "About" page, it does have a space to navigate to the different pages to shop, look at her blog posts, and contact the author.

Looking at the home page for this blog, we can apply specific topics from our weekly reading. There are **bolded titles**, *italicized sentences*, centered paragraphs, and even an embedded video to her YouTube channel. Navigating to [the most recent blog post](https://mrsdowjones.com/blogs/mdj-diary/emergency-fund), I can see that this blog is very simple compared to my example last week, [The Financial Diet](https://thefinancialdiet.com/). Because of this, it is a perfect example to use in this week's reflection post!

To navigate to the blog posts on the website, simply click on “MDJ Diary” in the navigation bar. This will take you to a basic page where all of the blog posts are located. The title of the most recent blog post, "Emergency Fund”, is bolded and centered on the page. There is an inserted GIF below the title and there some bolded phrases in the blog post itself. Creating a blog post to have these types of details is what we read about in the weekly reading, "What is Markup?". I hope this entire blog was not coded by hand in HTML because that would be very inefficient! One aspect of this blog post that has not been discussed in class yet is the large purple box that contains more information about emergency funds. At the end of the blog post, there is an embedded video for her related YouTube video.

In [this](https://mrsdowjones.com/blogs/mdj-diary/how-to-negotiate-a-salary-cut-with-chris-voss) blog post, there is a list that looks similar to the lists discussed in our weekly reading. The list on the blog post has plus signs (+) instead of roman numerals or an open circle as the bullet point. This specific blog post about negotiating salary cuts even has a purple defined horizontal line, or a rule as named by the standard. If I was to create this type of horizontal line break in a blog post of mine, I would have to add three hyphens (---) on a line by themselves.

Additionally, this blog has a small store to purchase some products, which has multiple links for different categories in the drop down menu. It also has the blog's linked social media, which makes me think I should now link *my* Instagram to my blog. I'll get back to that idea next week.
