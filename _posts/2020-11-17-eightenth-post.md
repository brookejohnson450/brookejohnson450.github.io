title: Reflection Post - Final Project Week 1
categories:
- reflection post

Let me quickly just point out the elephant in the room: this reflection post is late. I am not happy with it either, but it is what it is. So here I am, on a lonesome Tuesday night, trying to redeem myself as a consistent blogger. Please, forgive me.

In my defense, I did get engaged! My family came up, my boyfriend got down on one knee, and my entire weekend seemed to fly by! Anyway, so that is why this blog post is VERY late. No excuses, but still.

Back to the final project! My blog is still a baby blog unfortunately. My largest concern was the domain name. Since this project will continue with me after this class ends, I wanted it to have a more professional domain name. This article from [Medium](https://medium.com/20percentwork/creating-your-blog-for-free-using-jekyll-github-pages-dba37272730a) talks about how to start your blog in GitHub, much like we did in class, along with how to change the domain name!! Can I get a whoop because we are making progress!

My other concern is that I never fully figured out the VSC thing. I hope I can figure that out in the next week because that will make my life soooo much easier! The blog post from Medium also covers that topic. I will probably need some outside help on this, but I will keep you updated.

[This blog post](https://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2018/04/04/42537/) discusses the pros and cons of building your blog on GitHub using Jekyll. One thing I did not mention in my proposal that I would like to complete for the final project deadline, if I have time, is to implement a comment section and SEO into my blog. In this blog posts, it says I will need to use an outside provider for comments. For SEO, I will need to take “special measures” that they outlined in another blog post.

I am choosing to create my blog using GitHub rather than WordPress because I think it gives me more opportunities to learn, which is the purpose of this class. I can also directly apply what I learned each week to my blog. I have tried learning WordPress, and I like it, but I feel like GitHub is more of a hands-on experience and I will enjoy that. Plus, GitHub is free!

Each of the blog posts I linked in this post mentioned the Liquid templating language, which is not something I remember learning about in class. If you did not know, Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify. This is the backbone of Shopify themes.

Many of these blog posts I have come across are very helpful, and will continue to be helpful when I come across problems when creating my blog. Next week, or I guess this Friday, I hope I will have made actual progress on this blog. I know it seems like I am behind, and that would be a correct assumption, but I will be able to get it done.

Here is to getting ahead and making sure these posts are all over 500 words!!
