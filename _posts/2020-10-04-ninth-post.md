Guess who wrote an *entire* reflective blog post for the week only to realize that *it was for the wrong topic!!!* The answer: me! So here is round two for this week’s reflective blog post.

The topic is content and style in CSS. The weekly reading covered how CSS works, how to apply CSS to our blogs, and how to extend built-in styles in Jekyll. This week’s hands-on activity due date was pushed back a week so I do not have much to say about building my blog’s style and content yet. I’ll get back to that next week.

For this week’s real-life web artifact, I choose another YouTube video. This video titled [“CSS – Add Design to Your Website | Learn to Code”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8UeX4O5kVM) is by Coding Blonde. This video goes into the basics of CSS which was covered in the weekly reading. I thought that a YouTube video might be more helpful to someone if they learn better visually or want to feel like someone is actually walking them through the steps.

This video starts by describing how HTML and CSS interact, and then goes into actual coding. The website coding used in this video is simple and for beginners, but it was helpful in understanding the week’s hands-on activity.

The video discusses style, which was discussed in our weekly reading. Since our hands-on activity for CSS was pushed back a week, I have not worked on adding CSS to my blog yet. Looking at this YouTube video and the weekly reading, I think I want to make my blog have a minimalism feel to it. This YouTube video did not use GitHub, but that doesn’t make a difference to me because it is the same code just with a different program.

One thing that was not touched on in the video but was discussed in the weekly reading was editing CSS live in the browser. I can see how this is useful when trying to build a specific design. Without this tip, it would be time consuming to continually commit the code for my blog, wait for my blog to upload and refresh, and go back into the code to change it again if I did not like the display.

Both the YouTube video and the weekly reading discussed how you can override existing code for HTML and CSS to create your own custom CSS rules. Something that was not touched on in the video but mentioned in the weekly reading was combining selectors. I did not fully understand this, so I will need to do some outside research to better understand this topic.

Overall, I think that CSS will be a useful skill to learn but I have had a tough time applying it to my blog. I hope that with this extra time, the YouTube video, and reflecting back on the week that I will have a better understanding of how to add CSS to my blog. I will check back in with you on Wednesday and Friday to let you know how the process is going!
