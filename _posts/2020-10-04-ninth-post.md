Howdy! I can’t believe it is October already! Welcome to week 6 of English 460 where we learned about Metadata! Previously, I have used mostly blogs as examples to connect what we learned in class to a real-life web artifact. This week I wanted to do something different, so I googled “metadata” and started looking through the news articles until I found something interesting. The article I found, linked [here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/metadata-collection-violated-fisa-ninth-circuit-rules), is a blog post titled “Metadata Collection Violated FISA, Ninth Circuit Rules”. 

This article discusses the criminal case United States v. Moalin, a case in which four United States residents were convicted of conspiring to “provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and conspiring to launder money from 2007 to 2008”. This case was appealed and the defendants argued that the evidence brought against them in the trail was from an unlawful electronic surveillance program run by the National Security Agency (NSA). This program involved the collection of phone records, known as telephony metadata.

United States v. Moalin discusses whether it was lawful to use the metadata collected from the defendants in trail, but that is not my focus for this reflective post. My focus for this reflective post is the real world application of metadata. From this court case it can be seen that the topic of metadata was only discussed at a surface level during this week’s reading. As stated in the weekly reading, “metadata provides information about data”. You can read more information about this bulk collection of data on your own time and construct your own opinions about it. What I want to discuss today is this question: with this definition of metadata and the court case discussed above, how much metadata is there about each of us?

Looking further into more articles about this topic, I found some interesting articles. First, if you look into [Facebook’s Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php) you can read about the type of data Facebook collects from you. Facebook collects the content and communications you provide when using their products, such as sharing posts or messaging a friend. But, Facebook does say “This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created.” Going *even* further into this deep rabbit hole of metadata collection in the digital world, I learned that you can even download a copy of your Facebook data. Facebook tells you how to do this {here}(https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644). So that is what I did!

This is getting a little off topic from metadata, so let me steer us back to the main topic for the end this blog post. While we read about metadata in relation to our blog posts and Jekyll, I think it is good to expand our horizons a bit. No, this reflective post was not to go on a rampage about how we all need to throw our iPhones away and go off the grid. I just thought the topic of metadata was more applicable to my life and I wanted to learn more!
