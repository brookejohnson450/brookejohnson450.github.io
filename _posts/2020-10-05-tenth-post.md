October 5th Update:
Well, that was a tough two weeks. CSS is a new language for me, and I had a rough time getting into it. A few weeks back, I changed my theme to “Merlot” because I thought it would be a good idea! Update: it was not. I was struggling to change my theme using CSS, so I had to backtrack.

First, I changed my theme back to primer. Or at least, I tried to change it back. Apparently what I did was merge my themes of Merlot and Primer, which looked okay. It was a better starting point for applying what I learned about CSS, but it was not what I wanted it to be. Then I had to go back and make sure I had my blog pages and categories linked because that was lost when I copied the Primer theme back into my layout folder. I probably made this more difficult than it should have been, but I am learning and that is the important part!

After mindlessly deleting some code, I finally got my blog to have more of a blank look. But then another problem presented itself: how do I use CSS to make my blog look better? I thought that if I could figure out how to center my blog title using CSS, then I could do just about anything. This process took me over an hour, but *I FINALLY GOT MY BLOG TO BE CENTERED WITH A BLUE BACKGROUND!!* I am so happy that I am going to call it a day for English 460. I will work more on my blog on Tuesday and Wednesday, and I will continue updating this hands-on activity then.
