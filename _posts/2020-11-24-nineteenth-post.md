Full disclosure: This post was late. Just like last week. But today I am actually going to start this project! Yay to beating procrastination! This is my plan for today, 11/24/2020:

1. Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster. (I do not like waiting for the blog to relaod itself over and over again.)
  11/24 Notes:

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)

3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
