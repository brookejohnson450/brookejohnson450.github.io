categories:

**Full disclosure: This post was late. Just like last week. But today I am actually going to start this project! Yay to beating procrastination! This is my plan for today, 11/24/2020:**

1. Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster. (I do not like waiting for the blog to relaod itself over and over again.)
  11/24 Notes: I downloaded Visual Studio Code! This was a large task for me due to the lack of space on my computer. It took a while to delete programs and create enough space for Visual Studio Code, but once I did I ended up with another problem. My new problem is that I when I type on "git clone" to the command palette, nothing comes up. I think I need to install something else, but I am not sure what. I will work on this more tomorrow.

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
 **Here is my updates for the week:**

4. Write two blog posts. These do not have to be published yet.
  11/25 Notes: Started writing. Not nearly finished yet.

5. Create a strong skeleton of the blog, including pages, categories, search bar, social media links, and navigation bar. Design is not needed at this step.
  11/25 Notes: Not completed.
  
6. Create and write an About page.
  11/25 Notes: Have not even started.
  
  **Update for 12/4/2020**
  
  A few things: First, I did not know we only needed 12 relective blog posts. I was planning on writing for weeks after the last one was due. Second, I have not made much progress on my project becuase I have not worked on it much. With Thanksgiving, then three finals and two projects due, time management really kicked my butt the week. I am back! And oh so excited to be *this* close to my graudation! But first, ENGL 460.
