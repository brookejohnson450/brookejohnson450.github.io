title: Reflection Post 12 - Final Project Week 3
categories:

---

**Full disclosure: This post was late. Just like last week. But today I am actually going to start this project! Yay to beating procrastination! This is my plan for today, 11/24/2020:**

1. Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster. (I do not like waiting for the blog to relaod itself over and over again.)
  11/24 Notes: I downloaded Visual Studio Code! This was a large task for me due to the lack of space on my computer. It took a while to delete programs and create enough space for Visual Studio Code, but once I did I ended up with another problem. My new problem is that I when I type on "git clone" to the command palette, nothing comes up. I think I need to install something else, but I am not sure what. I will work on this more tomorrow.

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
 **Here is my updates for the week:**

4. Write five blog posts. These do not have to be published yet.
  11/25 Notes: Started writing. Not nearly finished yet.

5. Create a hand drawing of the blog, including pages, categories, search bar, social media links, and navigation bar. Code is not needed at this step.
  11/25 Notes: Not completed.
  
6. Create and write an About page.
  11/25 Notes: Have not even started.
  
  **Update for 12/4/2020**
  
  A few things: First, I did not know we only needed 12 relective blog posts. I was planning on writing for weeks after the last one was due. Second, I have not made much progress on my project becuase I have not worked on it much. With Thanksgiving, then three finals and two projects due, time management really kicked my butt the week. I am back! And oh so excited to be *this* close to my graudation! But first, ENGL 460.

1.Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster.
  12/4 Notes: I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO INSTALL GIT TO USE FOR VS CODE!!! It was a JOURNEY. Like, an influencer making a video about how they "changed their whole life" and began their "fitness journey". THAT kind of journey, you know? Anyway, after lots of blood and sweat and many, many tears I *think* I have it figured out. I used many sources, listed below:
  [The YouTube video that helped me start!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwyH2-VCVY)
  [The Meat & Potatoes of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
  [This nice forum that helped me figure out my path problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29971624/visual-studio-code-cannot-detect-installed-git)
  *Task 1 - Completed on 12/4*

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)
  12/4 Notes: I created my basic repository in Git so that I can clone it in VS Code using the URL. Look at me using all of this lingo! I am impressing myself!
  *Task 2 - Completed on 12/4*

3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
  12/4 Notes: I had my domain at Squarespace before I took this class and learned how to manage a blog on my own! So I used [this helpful page](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205812338-Transferring-a-domain-away-from-Squarespace) to transfer my domain to GoDaddy, which would be easier to use. It was also less than $2.00 to transfer, which is a blessing for my budget. *Task 3 - Completed on 12/4*

4. Write four blog posts. These do not have to be published yet.

5. Create a hand drawing of the blog, including pages, categories, search bar, social media links, and navigation bar. Code is not needed at this step.

6. Create and write an About page.

7. Route custom domain to github repository page.

8. Film and edit one video and create into a blog post.

9. Find a universal social media handle fro Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and TikTok.

10. Create blog landing page.
