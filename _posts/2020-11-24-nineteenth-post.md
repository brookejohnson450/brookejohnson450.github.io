categories:

---

**Full disclosure: This post was late. Just like last week. But today I am actually going to start this project! Yay to beating procrastination! This is my plan for today, 11/24/2020:**

1. Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster. (I do not like waiting for the blog to relaod itself over and over again.)
 
 11/24 Notes: I downloaded Visual Studio Code! This was a large task for me due to the lack of space on my computer. It took a while to delete programs and create enough space for Visual Studio Code, but once I did I ended up with another problem. My new problem is that I when I type on "git clone" to the command palette, nothing comes up. I think I need to install something else, but I am not sure what. I will work on this more tomorrow.

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)
  
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
  
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
 **Here is my updates for the week:**

4. Write five blog posts. These do not have to be published yet.
 
 11/25 Notes: Started writing. Not nearly finished yet.

5. Create a hand drawing of the blog, including pages, categories, search bar, social media links, and navigation bar. Code is not needed at this step.
  
  11/25 Notes: Not completed.
  
6. Create and write an About page.
  
  11/25 Notes: Have not even started.
  
  **Update for 12/4/2020**
 
 A few things: First, I did not know we only needed 12 relective blog posts. I was planning on writing for weeks after the last one was due. Second, I have not made much progress on my project becuase I have not worked on it much. With Thanksgiving, then three finals and two projects due, time management really kicked my butt the week. I am back! And oh so excited to be *this* close to my graudation! But first, ENGL 460.

1.Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster.
  
  12/4 Notes: I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO INSTALL GIT TO USE FOR VS CODE!!! It was a JOURNEY. Like, an influencer making a video about how they "changed their whole life" and began their "fitness journey". THAT kind of journey, you know? Anyway, after lots of blood and sweat and many, many tears I *think* I have it figured out. I used many sources, listed below:
 
 [The YouTube video that helped me start!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwyH2-VCVY)
 
 [The Meat & Potatoes of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
 
 [This nice forum that helped me figure out my path problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29971624/visual-studio-code-cannot-detect-installed-git)
 
 *Task 1 - Completed on 12/4*

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)
  
  12/4 Notes: I created my basic repository in Git so that I can clone it in VS Code using the URL. Look at me using all of this lingo! I am impressing myself!
  
  *Task 2 - Completed on 12/4*

3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
  
  12/4 Notes: I had my domain at Squarespace before I took this class and learned how to manage a blog on my own! So I used [this helpful page](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205812338-Transferring-a-domain-away-from-Squarespace) to transfer my domain to GoDaddy, which would be easier to use. It was also less than $2.00 to transfer, which is a blessing for my budget.
  
  *Task 3 - Completed on 12/4*

  **Update for 12/5/2020**

4. Write four blog posts. These do not have to be published yet.

12/5 Notes: The hardest part about writing blog posts is starting. I want a really good title and then I spend 30 minutes trying to think of one. Here is at tip: don't do that! I am just wasting time! I ended up drafting all four in the early afternoon. I started writing, and I decided I wanted to add something else to my blog. I want to add a statement of privilege, so to speak. Because I want to continue this blog after this class ends, I know that I want to write about certain difficult topics. I need to preference each of these blog posts with a statement of recognizing my own privilege. Instead of stating this at the top of each blog post, I thought that I could add a shorter statement to each blog post and create a seperate page of this statement. I will not be done writing these blog posts today, but I am making progress on them!

5. Create a hand drawing of the blog, including pages, categories, search bar, social media links, and navigation bar. Code is not needed at this step.

12/5 Notes: I completed this fairly quickly. During this step, I looked more into different blogs like I liked to see how they have their blog layed out and what kind of other information they add to their website. This helped me to have a blueprint to what I want to design.

*Task 5 - Completed on 12/5*

8. Film and edit one video and create into a blog post.
