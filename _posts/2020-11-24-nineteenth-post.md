Full disclosure: This post was late. Just like last week. But today I am actually going to start this project! Yay to beating procrastination! This is my plan for today, 11/24/2020:

1. Install and learn to use Visual Studio to code blog faster. (I do not like waiting for the blog to relaod itself over and over again.)
  11/24 Notes: I downloaded Visual Studio Code! This was a large task for me due to the lack of space on my computer. It took a while to delete programs and create enough space for Visual Studio Code, but once I did I ended up with another problem. My new problem is that I when I type on "git clone" to the command palette, nothing comes up. I think I need to install something else, but I am not sure what. I will work on this more tomorrow.

2. Create blog using GitHub (using previous notes from ENGL 460, and [these] websites)
  11/24 Notes: Dependent on Step 1. No new progress.
  
3. Transfer domain from Squarespace to GitHub
